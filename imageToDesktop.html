        <p class = "simpleText"> Image to Desktop is a very useful tool for creating projects
                                that require the user to download many images. It checks for new
                                images in the "Downloads" folder, and when an image is detected it
                                is automatically sent to "Desktop". Why keep "File Explorer" open, 
                                when you can grab any image you need from the desktop?<br>
