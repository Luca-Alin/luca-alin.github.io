            My name is Luca Alin and I am an aspiring programmer. My journey in
            programming with solving math problems in C++. After solving many math
            problems, I had the opportunity to apply my limited skills at that time
            into a real life situation: I created a program that could make a cash
            register print receipts. In order to combine the functionality of this code 
            with an user interface, I decided to use C#.
            I spent time thinkering with SQL, databases and some other programming languages.
            Some say write once, run everywhere. I say write once, run everywhere. This makes
            Java my fav
