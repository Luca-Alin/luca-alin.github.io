                After clicking the first square, numbers will appear on the screen. Each number is
                equal to the number of mines around it.
                It you think there is a mine under a certain square, you can click the right mouse 
                button to place a flag (a square covered by a flag cannot be clicked accidentaly).
                Note that the lower left counter is equal to the number of mines, and will help
                you know how many flags you have to place.

                Be careful! Clicking a square means you lose the game. Try again by pressing
                button with the sad face.
